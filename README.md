# Row/Column Mastery: Settings Screen


# 1. What the App Does

This Android application demonstrates a Settings screen built using Jetpack Compose and Material 3 components. The screen features a top app bar labeled Settings and includes multiple setting rows structured using proper Row and Column layout patterns. The app provides interactive toggle controls such as Switches and Checkboxes, as well as adjustable sliders for Volume, Brightness, and Text Size. A Save button is included at the bottom of the screen, which displays a Snackbar confirmation message when clicked. Each setting row, except those that require a slider, uses a Row as the main container with a Column on the left for the title and supporting text and an interactive control aligned on the right.
